  <h3>
    Thank you for visiting our website! This business was founded by Tanna Brauer. She had the idea to come up with this store because she was so tired of all Robots being so Robotic! If she was going to have Robots living with her then she wanted them to feel like they were part of the family! She wanted to be friends with them. Not to just feel like she had a slave. So thats when the experiments on adding personality to Robots first began. There really is no other Robot store like Robots R Us! If you would like to visit our store, we are located in <em>Moon City!</em>
